Ugandan author Kakwenza Rukirabashaija was picked up Tuesday by unknown people suspected to be plain clothes security operatives, moments after being freed. A court granted him bail earlier in the day on medical grounds. But shortly after being freed from Kitalya prison at 2.30pm, men dressed in plain clothes, forced him into a tinted double cabin vehicle that had no number plate and then drove off, his lawyer Erin Kiiza said.
