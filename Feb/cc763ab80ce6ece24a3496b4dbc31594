According to the Ecowas communiqué, the mission to be deployed to Guinea-Bissau, composed of military and police, will be deployed from The Gambia, where a stationary force of the organisation has been located since the elections that removed Yaya Jammeh from power in 2017. The last Ecowas stabilisation mission in Guinea-Bissau was deployed between 2012 and 2020, and the troops left the country after President Umaro Sissoco Embaló was inaugurated. At the time, President Embaló said he did not need the “foreign force” and that he trusted the country´s army.
