The US government has launched a third Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET) programme with Mozambique, to enhance the military’s readiness to contain rising insecurity. Washington has been conducting trainings with Maputo since March 2021 as part of the efforts to combat an insurgency in the country’s north. Since 2017 when armed rebels attacked numerous villages and destroyed extensive civilian property and infrastructure, including schools and health centres, the country’s Cabo Delgado province has been a subject of concerted regional and global efforts to tackle the terror merchants. An estimated 3,000 people have been killed and 820,000 displaced since the violence began. Apart from the US, the European Union (EU) is also training Mozambique forces in fighting the insurgency. In November, the EU launched its military training mission (EUTM) in Mozambique along with other programmes to tackle an insurgency in Cabo Delgado. According to the diplomatic representation, the programme launched Monday will last for 10 months during which the US army will partner with the Mozambican military to hone special operations skills. The JCET programme provides foreign military and US special operations forces an opportunity to exchange knowledge and best practices. In addition to military training, the two-month US Department of Defence (DoD) JCET exercise will focus on the law of armed conflict, human rights, and medical training. “Military exchanges like these are important for the security and prosperity of Mozambique and the region”, the statement quoted Dennis W. Hearne, the US Ambassador to Mozambique. “As a strategic partner, the United States is committed to ensuring our military-to-military engagements continue during such an important moment for Mozambique’s national security.”
