Khartoum, Sudan on Monday released 36 detainees from Soba Prison, who had been arrested following protests in the capital Khartoum during recent weeks, Sudanese Lawyers Committee says. “Those released from Soba prison are political prisoners who were arrested in connection with the recent protests,” the committee said on its Facebook page on Monday. They were transferred to police stations in Bahri, Omdurman and Khartoum cities, and were released after completing bails procedures, it added. Those who were released were part of more than 200 detainees, the lawyers said, pointing out the move was “a camouflage to mislead” Adama Dieng, the visiting UN Expert on Human Rights in Sudan. Dieng arrived in Khartoum on Sunday for a four-day visit, one month after Sudanese authorities asked him to postpone his visit. He met Sudan's acting Justice Minister Mohamed Saeed al-Hilu on Monday, and was scheduled to meet other people during his visit, including senior Sudanese government officials, representatives of civil society organisations, human rights defenders, heads of UN entities, and diplomats, according to the UN Human Rights Commission in Sudan. Dieng was appointed in November 2021 to monitor the human rights situation in Sudan. Sudan has suffered a political crisis since October 25, 2021 when the General Commander of the Sudanese Army, Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, declared a state of emergency and dissolved the Sovereign Council and the government. Since then, opposition groups have been staging regular mass protests in the capital Khartoum and in other cities to demand civilian rule.
