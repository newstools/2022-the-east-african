At least 34 people have died so far in a cholera epidemic that is sweeping the Central African nation of Cameroon, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Monday. The epidemic has hit at least four regions, including the Littoral region where the commercial capital Douala is located. In the Southwest region, 28 people have died, and 1,055 others infected. There are 77 cases and four deaths in the Littoral region, the South region has 52 cases and two deaths and the Far North region has reported eight cases, OCHA said. Cholera cases were first reported in localities in the Littoral and Southwest regions of the country in early January. Last week, Cameroon's Minister of Public Health Malachie Manaouda urged people to stay hygienic and report any infections to the hospital. Outbreaks of the water-borne disease occur regularly in Cameroon, mainly due to poor sanitation and a lack of access to clean drinking water. Cholera, which is spread by ingesting fecal matter, causes acute watery diarrhea and can kill within hours if not treated.
