A Group of Arab ambassadors in Kenya has condemned last week's killing of an Iraqi citizen in Nairobi. He was allegedly killed by gunmen riding on a motorcycle in Nairobi's Lavington area on Friday last week. In a statement, the ambassadors termed the attack as cowardly and unfortunate. “The Group of Arab Ambassadors in Nairobi have received the news of the demise of Mr Mazen Matti Hanna, an Iraqi National IOM staff, in the unfortunate incident that took place in Lavington last Friday. “We convey our sincerest condolences to his family and friends, as well as the entire family of IOM in Kenya,” the statement says. Police believe the robbers were out to steal his mobile phone when he was attacked and shot. He was jogging near his residence along Gitanga road when three gunmen pounced on him at around 6.30pm. According to witnesses, the assailants demanded for his mobile phone and cash but he resisted, prompting the attack that left him seriously injured. He was rushed to hospital by well-wishers but was pronounced dead on arrival. Mr Hanna was a finance officer at International Organization for Migration (IOM) Kenya's Nairobi office. Nairobi region deputy police boss James Mugera said no suspects had been arrested by Tuesday afternoon. Rampant cases of muggings in the streets of Nairobi have seen foreign missions issue travel advisories to their citizens living in Kenya. They warn against travelling along particular routes in Nairobi over fears of kidnapping and violent muggings.
