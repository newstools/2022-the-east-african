International model Millen Mages did a guest appearance at the Lady in Red fashion show held at the Serena Hotel, Dar es Salaam to coincide with Valentine’s Day. The show was hosted by multi-talented musician Mimi Mars and stand-up comedian Evans Bukuku, and it featured 17 designers, three of whom are deaf. The show gave young and up-and-coming fashion designers an opportunity to showcase their work. Fiderine Iranga, a former model-turned-fashion designer, showed her collection, Mahaba, appropriately named and coloured red and black to celebrate the season of love. Similarly, model and fashion designer Victoria Martin’s collection featured different colours besides red, and Tydo’s collection throwing in pink ensembles. The event was graced by Miss Tanzania 2019 Sylvia Sebastian, who was first on the catwalk. Asia Idarous, founder of the Lady in Red event fashion show that celebrates love in style, appeared on the stage in an amazing red dress. The different and exciting collection was by Katona Kashona dubbed Magari Mabovu collection (junk vehicles collection) with models carrying car parts — tyres and chains — on the catwalk. He said the intention was to show diversity. “I wanted to do something that was unusual and so when I started designing, I realised there were many abandoned cars due to owner fatigue or road unworthiness,” said Kashona. The Best Lady in Red male model 2022 went to Ahmed Lincoln; Best Lady in Red designer 2022 went to Winnie Nzunda; Best Lady in Red Female model 2022 was won by Ivonn Paul, and Lady in Red Life Time Achievement was taken by Taji Liundi.
