The bloc's current chair, Senegalese President Macky Sall, and Moussa Faki Mahamat, chair of the African Union Commission, said in a joint statement they were "extremely concerned" by the invasion. They called on Russia to "respect international law, the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Ukraine".
