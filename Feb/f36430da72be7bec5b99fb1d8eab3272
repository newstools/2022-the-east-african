 United Nations, The UN Security Council met behind closed doors Tuesday to discuss last month's coup in Burkina Faso but failed to agree on a joint statement on the junta's takeover, diplomats said. According to a draft statement circulated by Ghana, the Security Council would express "concern" about the coup and demand the restoration of constitutional order, as well as the release of ousted president Roch Marc Christian Kabore.

However, the Council's 15 members did not agree on the statement. "We still have to negotiate," a diplomatic source told AFP. During the meeting, the Council members were briefed by the UN representative in West Africa, Mahamat Saleh Annadif, who recently visited Burkina Faso on a joint mission with an Ecowas representative. Last week, Ecowas decided against toughening sanctions against Burkina Faso and instead demanded a timetable for a swift return to civilian rule.

On January 24, Burkina Faso's military toppled the elected Kabore, who is currently under house arrest. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the day after the putsch that military coups are "unacceptable."
