In Birmingham Ugandan youngster Victor Kiplangat put up a brilliant performance to win the men's marathon gold at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham on Saturday. Kiplangat struck gold in 2:10:55 ahead of Tanzania's Felix Simbu, while Kenya's late entrant into the field, Michael Githae, completed a 1-2-3 sweep of the medals by the three East African neighbours. Kiplangat's exploits made him the first Ugandan to win the Commonwealth Games gold in the marathon.
