Authorities in Somaliland, a breakaway region of Somalia, on Tuesday suspended the operations of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), accusing the broadcaster of "undermining the credibility of the Somaliland state." Information minister Saleban Yusuf Ali Kore told a press conference in the northwestern region's capital Hargeisa that "the BBC failed to recognise Somaliland as a democratic country that has stood on its feet for 30 years." "Starting from today, I have commanded all functions related to BBC in Somaliland to be suspended," he said. "The ears of the Somaliland people do not deserve the statements which the BBC uses to describe Somaliland."
