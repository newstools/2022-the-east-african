A senior US general told Congress Tuesday that the United States will sell Egypt advanced F-15 fighter jets, despite concerns in Washington over Cairo's human rights record. "In the case of Egypt, I think we have good news, in that we are going to provide them with F-15s, which was a long, hard slog," Central Command head General Frank McKenzie told the Senate Armed Services Committee. He did not provide details on the sale, and the State Department, which has to sign off on it, has yet to officially notify Congress of a sale, as it is required to do. "We don't speak to potential arms transfers or arms sales until and unless they're notified to Congress," said State Department spokesperson Ned Price. In January the US announced approval of two major military equipment sales to Egypt, covering 12 C-130 J Super Hercules transports and accompanying equipment, worth $2.2 billion, and ground-based air defense systems worth $355 million. But the State Department last year put on hold $130 million worth of military aid to Egypt, because of lack of improvement in the human rights situation in the country. And several influential members of Congress have urged President Joe Biden to hold back on military sales and aid until Cairo improves its record.
