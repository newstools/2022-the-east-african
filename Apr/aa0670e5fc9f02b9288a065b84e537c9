DR Congo President Félix Tshisekedi arrived in Nairobi late Wednesday evening two weeks after his last trip to the city. He was last in Nairobi early this month for the signing of the treaty for the accession of the DRC into the East African Community together with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is the current EAC chairman. During the early April visit, he also attended the mini-summit on regional security that brought together the two leaders and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda.
