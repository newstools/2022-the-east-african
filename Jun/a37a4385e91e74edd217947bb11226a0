Yesterday [Saturday], the doctors tried to replace his vein, but he passed on at 5.00 am Sunday,” Dr Machar said in his statement. He said preparations were underway for his body to be flown to Juba and that burial arrangements would be communicated later. The late Manawa was the Sudan People Liberation Movement-In Opposition (SPLM-IO) chair of the National Committee for Information and Public Relations. He also served as a member of the SPLM-IO Political Bureau. “On behalf of SPLM/A-IO and South Sudanese people, I am conveying our deep condolences to his family, members of the revitalised unity government and members of SPLM-IO as a party,” said Dr Machar.
