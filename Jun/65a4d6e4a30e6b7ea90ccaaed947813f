Uganda’s automotive startup Kiira Motors Corporation (KMC) is racing to make up for lost time as full funding for the project is now available and the firm can log its first commercial orders. Civil contractor National Enterprise Corporation is putting the final touches to the assembly facility in Jinja. Shipments of tooling for both the manufacturing facility and final assembly lines is expected to arrive in November. The Finance ministry released Ush159 billion ($42 million) to KMC mid-May, completing the government’s Ush218 billion ($58 million) financial commitment. “Now that we have the resources, we are running at full throttle to catch up on lost time. All contractors are engaged and active on site and expect series production to start next June,’ said chief executive Paul Isaac Musasizi. Construction is underway on the core manufacturing facility and the 30,000 square metre quality certification and testing facility.
