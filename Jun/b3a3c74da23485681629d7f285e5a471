Residents in the border city of Goma on Wednesday held demonstrations in support of the DR Congo armed forces, FARDC, as the tension between the government and neighbouring Rwanda continues to simmer. On foot and motorbikes, the residents threatened to cross into Rwanda to protest the “aggression” against the DRC. The demonstrators were stopped at the border post by the Congolese police, who teargassed them. At least one person was injured, according to AFP.

Banks, petrol stations, schools, shops and other outlets were closed across Goma, and only a few pharmacies appeared to be open. The resurgence and violence from last November by the M23, which has been laying ambush on FARDC troops, has intensified since March. The group is alleged to be receiving weapons from foreign funders.
