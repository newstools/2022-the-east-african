The East African Legislative Assembly on Thursday paid tribute to Kenya’s former president Mwai Kibaki, who died on April 22. “Not only was he an eminent leader for Kenya but also for East African countries. One thing I can remember is the political side; he was a gentleman and non-confrontational. He has gone out of the sight of Kenyans and EAC but not from the hearts,” said Victor Burikukiye, an EALA member from Burundi. Rwandan member Fatuma Ndangiza said, “He will be remembered for free primary education because education is the key to development in the country. He contributed to the stabilisation of the country after the 2007 election violence. At the level of Rwanda and East Africa as a whole, we know he has contributed greatly to lay foundation to the two pillars customs union and common market protocol, and the joining of Rwanda and Burundi into the EAC.” They spoke during an EALA sitting in Arusha, Tanzania.
