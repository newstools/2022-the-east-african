The amount is part of the Tsh14.94 trillion ($6.4 billion) that he requested Parliament to endorse for his ministry’s budget for the next financial year that is set to kick off on July 1, he said on Tuesday. Dr Nchemba told Parliament that out of the Tsh14.94 trillion ($6.4 billion), about Tsh13.62 trillion ($5.8 billion) is meant for recurrent expenditures, with the rest being channelled into development projects.
