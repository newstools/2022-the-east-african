The Rwandan government said on Wednesday it was still committed to taking in asylum seekers sent by the UK under a controversial deal after a first flight was cancelled following a European court ruling. "We are not deterred by these developments. Rwanda remains fully committed to making this partnership work," government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo told AFP. "The current situation of people making dangerous journeys cannot continue as it is causing untold suffering to so many," she said. "Rwanda stands ready to receive the migrants when they do arrive and offer them safety and opportunity in our country."
