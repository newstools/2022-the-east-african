Rwanda will host the new African Pharmaceutical Technology Foundation, a venture by the African Development Bank (AfDB) that is expected to boost the continent’s access to technology in manufacturing medicines and vaccines. AfDB said the foundation is crucial to help African pharmaceutical companies better scout for technologies and negotiate with global pharma to facilitate local production of the fundamental health products that take up to $14 billion of Africa’s income annually.

AfDB says the foundation will now support the “direct implementation of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (Trips) on non-exclusive or exclusive licensing of proprietary technologies, know-how and processes,” which should boost the pharma’s production capacity.

According to WTO Director-General Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the undertaking “provides part of the infrastructure needed to assure an emergent pharmaceutical industry in Africa.” Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organisation, said the foundation is “a game-changer on accelerating the access of African pharmaceutical companies to IP-protected technologies and know-how in Africa.” Also read: Big pharma tried to scuttle Africa bid to manufacture Covid-19 vaccines locally
