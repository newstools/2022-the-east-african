Makamba also confirmed that Tanzania is in the final stage of securing loans from the IMF and World Bank to help ease the high cost of living. Zuhura Yunus, Tanzania’s Director of Presidential Communications, added that, “Following fuel prices acceleration and the high cost of living, Tanzania requested a soft loan of Tsh1.1 billion ($473,000) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last month during President Samia Suluhu Hassan talks with Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of IMF.” The IMF team was in Tanzania last month for further talks on the three-year loan. In July 2021, Tanzania imposed a Tsh100 ($0.043) surcharge on petrol, diesel, and kerosene. This was suspended in February this year to ease rising fuel costs in the country, and the suspension remained in place until May 2022. According to Makamba, Tanzania lost more than Tsh102 billion ($43.8 million) in revenue over reduced tariffs and tax from fuel.
