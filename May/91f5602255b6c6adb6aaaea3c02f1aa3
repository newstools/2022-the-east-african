The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat has invited small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and startups in the manufacturing sector, and creatives to take part in a brand contest geared towards boosting the small businesses. The Brand Hackathon was launched on April 29 to mark AfCFTA’s third anniversary. AfCFTA Secretary-General Wamkele Mene and the AfCFTA Champion, former Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou challenged African businesses to participate in the hackathon. “AfCFTA warmly invites SMEs/startups in the product manufacturing space, and brand artists and other brand creatives who can help such SMEs to refresh the brand identity of their products in order to boost sales, to participate in the hackathon,” said the statement.
